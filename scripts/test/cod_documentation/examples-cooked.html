            <p>By what factor would a person's weight at the surface of Earth change if Earth had its present mass but eight times its present volume?</p>
            <div class="title"><b>Solution</b></div>
            <p>With eight times the volume, Earth's radius would double. This means the gravitational force at the surface would reduce by a factor of (1/2)<sup>2</sup> = 1/4, so a person would weigh only one-fourth as much.</p>

            <p>By what factor would a person's weight at the surface of Earth change if Earth had its present size but only one-third its present mass?</p>

            With one-third its present mass, the gravitational force at the surface would reduce by a factor of 1/3, so a person would weight only one-third as much.</p>
