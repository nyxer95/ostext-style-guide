    <title>Calculating Weight</title>
    By what factor would a person’s weight at the surface of Earth change if Earth had its present mass but eight times its present volume?
  </para>
  <para>
    <title>Solution</title>
    With eight times the volume, Earth’s radius would double. This means the gravitational force at the surface would reduce by a factor of (1/2)<sup>2</sup> = 1/4, so a person would weigh only one-fourth as much.

    <title>Answer:</title>
    <para>With one-third its present mass, the gravitational force at the surface would reduce by a factor of 1/3, so a person would weight only one-third as much.</para>
